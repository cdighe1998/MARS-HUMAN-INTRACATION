<font size="5" color="white"><br/>India's low-cost Mangalyaan spacecraft entered orbit around the Red Planet on Wednesday, September 24, after a 10-month-long journey.<br/> The success of the mission represents a milestone in the country's space program.<br/> "We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible," said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) headquarters near Bangalore.</br>
With this achievement, India joins a club of deep space explorers such as the United States, Russia and Europe, all of which have reached Mars. <br/>The success is also a reason for national pride as India became the first single nation to reach the Red Planet and enter orbit at its first go.<br/> More than half of all missions to the planet have failed, including China's in 2011 and Japan's in 2003.<br/> Moreover, at a cost of 74 million USD, the mission cost is less than the estimated 100 million USD budget of the Hollywood blockbuster "Gravity" and represents just a fraction of NASA's MAVEN spacecraft, which began to successfully orbit the planet just a few days ago.</font>
